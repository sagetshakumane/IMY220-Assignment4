# IMY220-Assignment4

• Use jQuery to add the functionality to be able to send messages using the provided form and embed an iframe if a YouTube link is detected.
• Download index.html from ClickUP. This file contains the markup for an input tag and two buttons that you will use to send messages. You will need to create and include a new file called script.js which will contain all the code for this assignment. You are not allowed to add any markup, such as classes or ids, to the code in index.html. You are however allowed to make some changes to the internal CSS that is provided.
• You must use.on() for event handling and you must use the recommended syntax from the slides for adding new elements.

Bonus
If you got the assignment working, you will notice that you are only able to get one link to show up as an iframe at a time. Add functionality to be able to send multiple YouTube links in one message and get them to show up as iframes in the same message. These iframes should be added underneath each other.
